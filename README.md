# Understanding-risk-from-global-risk-index
Natural disasters and conflicts are two of the most significant threats to global stability and human security
This research aims to bridge this gap by studying the intersection of natural disaster risk and conflict exposure to understand the compounded vulnerabilities faced by at-risk regions. The primary objective is to identify regions most affected by the dual threats of natural disasters and conflicts and propose actionable strategies for policymakers and humanitarian organizations.
Methodology
The methodology employs the DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) framework. Data preprocessing involves standardizing indices, handling missing data, and validating variables. Analytical techniques include sentiment analysis, word clouds, and topic modelling to understand regional dynamics. Statistical modelling and clustering algorithms are used to classify high-risk regions, while visualization tools such as dashboards and heatmaps provide intuitive insights. Machine learning algorithms, including Random Forests and Logistic Regression, are applied to assess correlations between disaster risks and conflicts
